## Bookmark Project	

This is a simple server that allows one to make keywords for their main urls, and typing in the keyword will take 
one to the url. It is useful for remembering long urls. 
Basically, its a bookmark, already built into most web browsers. I am just making one so I 
know how it works, as I learn web dev...
